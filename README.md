# Next.js 15 'this' Keyword Error in Functional Components

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications when using the `this` keyword within functional components.  In Next.js 15, functional components do not have their own `this` context.

## Problem

The `about.js` file contains a functional component that attempts to access `this`.  This results in a runtime error because `this` is undefined in this context.

## Solution

The `aboutSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the component.  The solution involves removing the use of `this` and adopting appropriate techniques to access needed context or data.
